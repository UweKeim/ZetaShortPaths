# Zeta Short Paths

A .NET Standard library with all the goodies from ZetaLongPaths to work with files and folders for paths with less than 260 characters.

## Introduction

With the success of my library [Zeta Long Paths](https://github.com/UweKeim/ZetaLongPaths), a.NET library to access files and directories with more than 260 characters length, I came up with several small, nice helper classes and functions.

This library here encapsulates these functions and makes them available in a .NET Standard library to work on the non-long built-in file I/O functions of the .NET Framework (both Full and Core).

## Quick usage

- **[NuGet .NET Standard package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZetaShortPaths)**
